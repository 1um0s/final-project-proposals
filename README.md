# Final Project Proposal 2021
To submit final project proposal:
* For this repository, and clone your forked copy.
* Create a directory named `<net-id1>-<net-id2>`  where `net-id1` is the NYU
  NetID of the first member of your group, and `net-id2` is the NetID of the
  second member. For example if your NetID is `ja111` and your partner's NetID
  is `pb122` then you should create a directory named `ja111-pb122`.
  If you are working on the project alone your directory should just be named 
  `<net-id>`, and if you are in a three person group your directory should be
  named `<net-id1>-<net-id2>-<net-id3>`.
* Copy `template.md` into your directory, rename it to `project.md`.
* Edit the file, and fill out the details. You can add more sections if it
    helps, and you can choose to include references at the end rather than
    linking to them if you prefer.
* Commit your changes, and push to your forked copy.
* Submit a pull request to this repository, entitle you pull request `Project
    Proposal <net ID 1> <net ID 2>`.
